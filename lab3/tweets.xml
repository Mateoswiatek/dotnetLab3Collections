    <Text>@CHSommers My parents are Gen X and they taught me how to be a good person, to work hard because nothing is free, to always look over my shoulder because everyone is crazy, and most importantly that other people don't define me. So why don't you just mind your own business old woman.</Text>

    <Text>Women are often told to avoid "weak" language like "I think," but the truth is it's often more accurate. I find it more troubling when people state their opinion as if it's an undisputed fact.  We don't need to fix women; we need to appreciate what they're already doing.</Text>

    <Text>And the women of color who have led the repro justice movement teach us that these issues are bigger than Roe. We must go beyond abortion to ensure access to contraception, STI prevention &amp;amp; care, sex ed, care for pregnant moms, safe home &amp;amp; work environments, good wages, &amp;amp; more.</Text>

    <Text>If you know a man who refuses to cry, you've seen toxic masculinity.  If you've called a man a "pussy," a "fairy," or a "little bitch," you've engaged in it.  If you've judged, harassed, or devalued a man for lack of aggression, you've reinforced it.  Encourage empathy instead.</Text>

I think it's more that many statues were erected during the Civil Rights Movement (60-100yrs later) as a way to remind blacks that white still didn't like them even if the law said they were equal. If they were put up during the actual war, it might be a little different</Text>

    <Text>Stop saying the crowd at Trump's rally tonight was low because of "Tic Tok teens."  That is untrue.  The campaign never capped tickets at the venue capacity.  So Trump's base could still get tix.    But they didn't want them. They didn't show up.  That is the bigger story.</Text>

Can you provide me some examples of your GOP reaching out to Dems over past 4 years to promote bipartisanship on major issues? Kinda sounds like you want the Dems to do what the GOP downright refused to do in recent years. #DoAsISayNotASIDo</Text>

    <Text>@RepWalberg I do hope the Democrats do the right thing here   &amp;amp;  Ignore all talk from the GOP and push this thru without their support. Republicans don't care about getting Dem support in their legislative agenda. I know they would see negotiating in any form as week and timid. Push it thru</Text>

Dems giveaways promote equality &amp;amp; fairness, Repubs giveaways promote the opposite, for example, tax breaks the to super wealthy. I agree. This disparity would bug the shit out of me if I were a Republican.</Text>

    <Text>..these laws seem to get interpreted more along the lines of realizing that sex is even happening (which would be like &amp;gt; 0.20% BAC to be illegal) whereas reduced judgment to the level of a teenager's is less than half that, like what is illegal for driving.</Text>

    <Text>This is not to say that people shouldn't be allowed to have drunk sex. But there should be a previous understanding before getting drunk. People who sexually target intoxicated people without such previous understanding are rapists. The justice system should treat them as such.</Text>

They tweet wise things, and inevitably some chud pops up in the replies to dismiss their discernment with variations on "this is why women shouldn't try to lead worship." It annoys me every time and I'm not the *object* of this contempt https://t.co/cY39PUFeLs</Text>

    <Text>..these laws seem to get interpreted more along the lines of realizing that sex is even happening (which would be like &amp;gt; 0.20% BAC to be illegal) whereas reduced judgment to the level of a teenager's is less than half that, like what is illegal for driving.</Text>

    <Text>I am convinced that if you believe someone is too drunk to drive, and/or you would warn them to sober up before signing legal documents, then they do not have the necessary capacity to consent and targeting them for sex in such a state should absolutely be considered rape.</Text>

    <Text>This is not to say that people shouldn't be allowed to have drunk sex. But there should be a previous understanding before getting drunk. People who sexually target intoxicated people without such previous understanding are rapists. The justice system should treat them as such.</Text>

A federal statute would gtee expressly, and would trump state law via Supremacy Clause. Other args might come up, but fed statute would be forceful.</Text>

As if @SpeakerPelosi &amp;amp; @WhipClyburn didn't know cuellar was anti-choice &amp;amp; NRA-backed when they raised funds &amp;amp; personally CAMPAIGNED FOR HIM!! They went to great lengths to make sure a progressive pro-choice WOC didn't win. Shameful.</Text>

This is a self-inflicted wound, because they keep failing to understand how this works.   A labor movement needs to be non-partisan, and more selective of who they support and oppose.</Text>

    <Text>Autism cannot be "cured".  It is a neurotype, a type of way for the brain and body to be wired and a way of experiencing the world. Wanting it "cured" is called Eugenics.  This family is hideously ableist and eugenicist. CBC didn't bother talking to any autistic people, as usual. https://t.co/5pVJ4q6Fai</Text>
